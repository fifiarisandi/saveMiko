            <p>This is Miko, he's a rescued dog.</p>

            <p>Lucky for him, he's found a loving family who loves him and gives him a home.
                Sadly, not many dogs are as lucky as him. 
            </p>
            <p>Some end up living on the streets and are often abused by people. 
                Some others spend their lives in poor conditions in animal shelters as many 
                animal shelters struggle to fund their operational activities</p>
            <p>On the other hand, there are many people out there who want to keep a dog, 
                yet their life situation doesn't allow to do so.
