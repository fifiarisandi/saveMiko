                    <p>I’m a happy boy you can always find me wagging my tail with a huge smile on my face. 
                        I’ve also got a big appetite, and I’m a fan of long walks in the grass and the odd game of fetch... 
                        with my orange water bottle of course!
                    </p>
                    <p>I was a stray before I came here. I get really anxious and wary around new people and dogs so finding a home that suits me is tricky.

                    <p> 
                        I’m a very clever pooch and I’m always learning news tricks! I especially love clicker training - I must be really good at it because I get loads of treats! 
                    </p>
                    <p>I came here because I started to get really nervous around people I don't know and my owners weren’t able to look after me anymore. 
                        It can take me a while to trust someone new and I sometimes get wary around other dogs too when they want to share my food.

                    <p>I have such a fun time playing scent games with my carers and sniffing around the fields to see what I can find. 
                        I love a good splash about in the local river too!  
                    </p>
                    <p>I can be very protective over my things and can get very anxious around people I don't know.
                        However, I'm super lucky that my carers here understand me, know all my quirks and are helping me build my confidence around people.
